# Linked-List
A linked list is a data structure used to store a collection of elements. Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous memory locations, linked lists consist of nodes that are connected through pointers. Each node contains two main components:

1. Data: The value or information the node holds.

2. Next: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

â–ŽTypes of Linked Lists

1. Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node and the last node points to None.

2. Doubly Linked List: Each node contains a reference to both the next and the previous node.

3. Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
